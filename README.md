# Jarvis

**A 100% private AI voice assistant that lives on your computer** (works offline). Talk naturally as if Jarvis is a third person in the room — say its name anywhere in your sentence and get conversational, context-aware responses. It remembers everything, always knows the current location and time, can search the web, read your screen, control Chrome, track nutrition, and much more with support for unlimited MCPs and tools without context rot. Sensitive info is automatically redacted before anything is saved to disk.

🔒 100% local processing. No subscriptions. No data harvesting. Automatic redaction of sensitive info. Free offline dictation included.

## Why Jarvis?

**🔒 Your data stays yours** - 100% local AI processing. No cloud, no subscriptions, no data harvesting. Automatic redaction of sensitive info. This is non-negotiable.

**🗣️ A third person in the room** - Unlike voice assistants that only respond to rigid commands, Jarvis understands conversations. It maintains a short temporary rolling context of what's being discussed, so when you ask "Jarvis, what do you think?" it knows exactly what you're talking about. Have it chime into discussions with friends, help debug code while you talk through problems, or weigh in on decisions.

**🧠 Never forgets** - Unlimited memory across conversations. Adapts tone naturally to the topic. Learns your preferences over time.

**🎙️ Free dictation** - Hold a hotkey, speak, release — your words appear in any app as text. Like WisprFlow, but free, offline, and private. No subscription, no cloud transcription.

**🔌 Extensible** - MCP integration connects Jarvis to thousands of tools: smart home, GitHub, Slack, databases, and more. Smart tool selection means adding more tools won't slow things down.

**📊 Transparent progress** - We track what works (and what doesn't) with automated evals. [See current accuracy →](EVALS.md)

**🚧 Known limitations:** Jarvis is under active development. Primary development happens on macOS. Windows/Linux support may lag behind. We're building in the open, [issues](https://github.com/isair/jarvis/issues) and [contributions](https://github.com/isair/jarvis/pulls) welcome!
- Voice-only for now—no text chat interface yet ([#35](https://github.com/isair/jarvis/issues/35))
- No mobile apps ([#17](https://github.com/isair/jarvis/issues/17))
- "Stop" commands during speech sometimes get filtered as echo ([#24](https://github.com/isair/jarvis/issues/24))
- Dictation is not available on macOS 26+ (Tahoe) due to a pynput incompatibility ([#172](https://github.com/isair/jarvis/issues/172))

## System Requirements

| Hardware | VRAM | Model |
|----------|------|-------|
| Most users | 8GB+ | `gemma4:e2b` (default) |
| Better quality | 16GB+ | `gemma4:e4b` |
| High-end | 24GB+ | `gpt-oss:20b` |

> **Note:** VRAM requirements include the intent judge model (`gemma4:e2b`) which is always loaded alongside the chat model for voice intent classification. The default model shares this, so no extra VRAM is needed.

The setup wizard will guide you through model selection and installation on first launch.

## Configuration

Most users won't need to change anything. Open **⚙️ Settings** from the tray menu to configure Jarvis through a graphical interface — no JSON editing required. Settings are saved to `~/.config/jarvis/config.json`.

<details>
<summary><strong>Speech Recognition (Whisper)</strong></summary>

#### Language Modes
- **Multilingual** (default, 99 languages): `"whisper_model": "medium"`
- **English Only** (slightly better English accuracy): `"whisper_model": "medium.en"`

#### Model Sizes
| Model | English | Multilingual | Download | VRAM | Speed |
|-------|---------|--------------|----------|------|-------|
| Tiny | `tiny.en` | `tiny` | ~75 MB | ~1 GB | ~10x |
| Base | `base.en` | `base` | ~140 MB | ~1 GB | ~7x |
| Small | `small.en` | `small` | ~465 MB | ~2 GB | ~4x |
| **Medium** | `medium.en` | `medium` | ~1.5 GB | ~5 GB | ~2x |
| Large V3 Turbo | - | `large-v3-turbo` | ~1.5 GB | ~6 GB | ~8x |

Speed is relative to the original large model. [Source](https://github.com/openai/whisper)

#### GPU Acceleration (Windows)
If you have an NVIDIA GPU, Jarvis can use CUDA for much faster speech recognition. The Windows installer offers an optional CUDA download during setup. For development:
```bash
pip install nvidia-cublas-cu12 nvidia-cudnn-cu12
```
CUDA is detected automatically — no configuration needed.

<details>
<summary><strong>Voice Interface (Advanced)</strong></summary>

**LLM Intent Judge** - Jarvis uses `gemma4:e2b` for intelligent voice intent classification (echo detection, query extraction, stop commands). This model is automatically installed alongside your chosen chat model during setup. The intent judge cannot be disabled but gracefully falls back to simpler text matching if Ollama is unavailable.

</details>

## Dictation Mode — Free WisprFlow Alternative

Hold a hotkey to record speech, release to paste the transcription into any app. Works everywhere — your editor, browser, chat, terminal. Completely local, completely free.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/img/dictation-history.png" alt="Dictation History" width="400">
  <img src="docs/img/setup-wizard-dictation.png" alt="Setup Wizard - Dictation" width="400">
</p>

| Platform | Default hotkey |
|----------|---------------|
| **Windows** | Ctrl + Win |
| **macOS** | Ctrl + Option |
| **Linux** | Ctrl + Alt |

- 🔒 **100% offline** — your speech never leaves your machine (unlike cloud dictation services)
- 🧠 **Shared Whisper model** — uses the same speech recognition as voice input, no extra memory
- ⚡ **Zero latency startup** — no server round-trip, transcription starts the moment you release
- 📋 **Universal paste** — works in any app that accepts `Ctrl+V` / `Cmd+V`
- 🔇 **Non-intrusive** — main voice listener pauses automatically during dictation
- ✋ **Hands-free mode** — double-tap the hotkey to keep recording without holding; press again or hit Escape to stop
- 🧹 **Filler word removal** — optional LLM-powered cleanup removes "um", "uh", "like", "you know" while preserving meaning
- 📖 **Custom dictionary** — define `"wrong -> right"` replacements for jargon, names, and technical terms
- 📜 **History window** — browse, copy, or delete past dictations from the system tray
- 🎛️ **Easy setup** — configure dictation during the setup wizard or anytime in Settings (hotkey dropdown, filler removal toggle, custom dictionary editor)

Customise the hotkey in Settings or `config.json`:
```json
{
  "dictation_hotkey": "ctrl+alt",
  "dictation_filler_removal": true,
  "dictation_custom_dictionary": [
    "jarvis -> Jarvis",
    "pytorch -> PyTorch"
  ]
}
```

> **Note:** macOS requires Accessibility permissions for the global hotkey. Linux requires X11 (limited Wayland support).

<summary><strong>Text-to-Speech</strong></summary>

**Piper TTS (default)** - Neural TTS that auto-downloads on first use (~60MB):
- Works out of the box - no setup required
- High-quality British English male voice (en_GB-alan-medium)
- Fast local synthesis with exact duration tracking

To use different Piper voices, download from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/rhasspy/piper-voices) and set:
```json
{
  "tts_piper_model_path": "~/.local/share/jarvis/models/piper/en_GB-alan-medium.onnx"
}
```

**Chatterbox** - AI voice with emotion control (requires running from source):
```json
{ "tts_engine": "chatterbox" }
```

Voice cloning with Chatterbox - add a 3-10 second .wav sample:
```json
{
  "tts_engine": "chatterbox",
  "tts_chatterbox_audio_prompt": "/path/to/voice.wav"
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Location Detection</strong></summary>

Jarvis can provide location-aware responses (weather, local time, etc.) using a local GeoLite2 database — no cloud geolocation services are used.

**IP detection chain** (in order of preference):
1. **Manual IP** — configure `location_ip_address` in settings
2. **UPnP** — queries your local router (no traffic leaves LAN)
3. **Socket heuristic** — determines which interface routes externally (no data sent)
4. **OpenDNS DNS query** — single `myip.opendns.com` lookup to `208.67.222.222` (only external query)

If your ISP uses carrier-grade NAT (CGNAT), Jarvis automatically resolves your true public IP via the same OpenDNS DNS query. This can be disabled:

```json
{
  "location_cgnat_resolve_public_ip": false
}
```

**Setup:** Register for a free [MaxMind GeoLite2](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite2/signup) account, download the City database (MMDB format), and save it to `~/.local/share/jarvis/geoip/GeoLite2-City.mmdb`. The setup wizard will guide you through this.

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>Common issues</strong></summary>

**Jarvis doesn't hear me** - Check microphone permissions, speak clearly after "Jarvis"

**Responses are slow** - Ensure you have enough VRAM (8GB+ for default model; see System Requirements for other models)

**Windows: App won't start** - Extract full zip first, check Windows Defender

**macOS: "App can't be opened"** - Right-click → Open, or System Settings → Privacy & Security → Allow

**Linux: No tray icon** - `sudo apt install libayatana-appindicator3-1`

</details>

## For Developers

<details>
<summary><strong>Running from source</strong></summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/isair/jarvis.git
cd jarvis

# macOS
bash scripts/run_macos.sh

# Windows (with Micromamba)
pwsh -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\run_windows.ps1

# Linux
bash scripts/run_linux.sh
```

Running from source enables Chatterbox TTS (AI voice with emotion/cloning). Piper TTS works in both bundled and source modes.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Privacy hardening</strong> (stay 100% offline)</summary>

```json
{
  "web_search_enabled": false,
  "mcps": {},
  "location_auto_detect": false,
  "location_cgnat_resolve_public_ip": false,
  "location_enabled": false
}
```

Verify: `sudo lsof -i -n -P | grep jarvis` (should only show 127.0.0.1 to Ollama)

</details>

## Privacy & Storage

- **100% offline** - No cloud services required
- **Auto-redaction** - Emails, tokens, passwords automatically removed
- **Local storage** - Everything in `~/.local/share/jarvis`
- **Audit log** - When the audit feature is enabled, tool usage is recorded to `audit.db` (a SQLite file stored alongside the main database). The log contains already-redacted user intent and tool decisions — no raw personal data is written. You can disable auditing by leaving `audit_db_path` unset in your config.
